aboutUsText=Online Energy Services allow City of Cape Town energy consumers (i.e properties that are within City electricity boundaries) the ability to electronically apply for the connection of embedded generation (such as PV Solar installations) or for new or modified service. \n \n The below are the Energy Online Application that you can assess to apply for a service. Please expand each application to view more information:
proxyWording1=If you would like to grant another person (for example, an electrical contractor, installer or any other relevant party) permission to act as proxy in order to submit an application for energy-related services (read more about the energy services here) on your behalf, you may request this using this ‘Proxy Application’ service. \n \n By filling out the form and attaching required documents, an application will be created to give the specified proxy permission for a specified period of time. \n \n
proxyWording2=Please take note of the following: \n \n  a.	Proxy permission can only be assigned to natural persons, not to companies. Thus, if you have contracted a company to do work for you, you must first request the ID number of the person who will be handling your applications. \n  b.	Proxy permission can only be assigned to e-services users with valid accounts. Before granting proxy permission, check that the person that you would like to assign permission to is a registered e-services user. \n c. The following documents are required to complete the request; \n - A copy of your ID document \n - A copy of the ID document of the person you are assigning proxy permission to \n - A proxy permission letter \n \n Note: Copies of any of the following ID documents are accepted: \n - Green-coded SA ID document, \n - SA Smart ID Card SA, \n -	Valid Drivers Licence, \n -	Valid passport document.\n \n d. Proxy permission will be allocated to a person for the specified period of time. Once this time has elapsed, a new "Proxy Authorisation Request" must be submitted, if required for a new period. \n e. Proxy permission can be revoked after the request was submitted by clicking on the "Revoke" button. Once revoked, a new "Proxy Authorisation Request" must be submitted, if required for a new period.
cvWording=All private service providers that offer energy-related services in support of residential or commercial SSEG installations or new/modified electricity supply are required to submit registration documents to the City for verification in order for the service provider to be listed on e-services. Once registered, if a service provider is added to any Energy Services application via e-services, they will be notified of the submission for security purposes.\n \n Note: Only once the submitted documents have been successfully verified by City officials will ‘SSEG applicants’ and ‘New/Modified Service Connection applicants’ be able to add the service providers for online applications submitted electronically via e-services. On successful verification, the service provider’s “registration number” will be accepted inputs on Energy Service application forms. For documents that have a validity period, the credentials will be removed from the system on expiry and a new ‘Credential Vetting’ request must be submitted with new validity dates. \n \n Installers offer SSEG installation services to the public. As such, installers must be in possession of a valid business (VAT) registration document that must be verified. \n \n Electrical Contractors issue a Certificate of Compliance on any electrical work they have done on a premise. As such, these providers must be in possession of a valid Department of Employment and Labour Registration document that must be verified. \n \n ECSA Registered Persons conduct evaluations and issue sign-off on embedded generation installations completed on residential or commercial premises before installations can be authorised by City officials. As such, service providers offering this service to the public must submit a copy of their ECSA registration certificate that must be verified.
